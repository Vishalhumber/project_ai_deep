# project_ai_deep 
This the project documentation for image generation from text to image using GPU and CPU and make the model as per the image trained and user oriented specific details will be added as we progress through the project 

Notes/House Keeping:

Please add your intials in comment section of code for ownership and discussion like 


print("sample text")#vk

Also take screenshots wherever you have tested and attach the images in repo so we can refer it for results

Feel free to update this document as you go 

# Step 0:
Getting concepts ready

- VQGAN + Clip (vk)
- Diffusion(simul)
- Taming Transformer(Kayen)

# Step 1 :
Create environement name it ai_deep and use the environment
Design the model and select the process and evaluate models performance 
# Step 2:
Identify Open Source AI and Models 
# Step 3:
Check for bugs 
# Step 4:
Test and Evaluate and improve
This document is progress and will be update as the project goes on (vk)
# Step 5:
